## 📄 Background
### 1. Increasing competition rate​ & Unclear passing criteria
42 School is rapidly gaining global recognition as a prestigious educational institution, particularly in Korea, where the competition rate is an astonishing 44 to 1. 
<br>
However, a significant challenge arises during the month-long testing period, as the nature of crucial activities remains shrouded in secrecy, posing a concern for prospective students and their preparation strategies.​

### 2. Increasing competition rate​ & Unclear passing criteria
There are 50 number of 42 campus and this education system is originated from 42 Ecole, which is the first campus of 42 school. 
<br>
42 As schools become increasingly global, cracks will inevitably appear in their operating policies and educational standards.​
<br>
It is unclear whether the students at 42 School are being evaluated according to the standards of 42 Ecole, which has originality.​
<br>
Our team was launched to solve this situation using **Business Analytics** techniques.

## 😎 Expectation 
Children can feel connected to each other and motivated even when they use our Sgether platform.  
In addition, AI's learning supervision allows you to objectively grasp your own learning status.

#### resolve
We have addressed this issue by introducing AI proctoring.

##  👍 Scalability of the project
Beyond self-study proctoring, we will collaborate with other large-scale education platforms to provide learning content. As a result, more users will be attracted, and more efficient and effective learning will be achieved through our project's technology.

We are also deploying the service using AWS EC2 cloud service. Therefore, scaling up based on the size of users can be easily performed and expansion can be prepared by dynamically increasing servers according to demand.
