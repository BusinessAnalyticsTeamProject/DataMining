##  🚏 Conclusion
Beyond self-study proctoring, we will collaborate with other large-scale education platforms to provide learning content. As a result, more users will be attracted, and more efficient and effective learning will be achieved through our project's technology.

We are also deploying the service using AWS EC2 cloud service. Therefore, scaling up based on the size of users can be easily performed and expansion can be prepared by dynamically increasing servers according to demand.
